# Tofugu Glossary

### Why

If you learning Japanese, you are probably familiar with [Tofugu's hiragana mnemonic page](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/).

If you found it frustrating to get to the hiragana you want because you had to scroll through multiple characters across the page, I made a chrome extension to inject a little window of all the hiragana so you can immediately jump to the section you need.
